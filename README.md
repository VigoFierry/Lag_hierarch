Lag_hierarch is a C++ library implementing a hierarchical statistical model for 3D Laguerre tessellation

The model is introduced in paper "Fitting three-dimensional Laguerre tessellations by hierarchical marked point process models"
available at arXiv:

dependencies: 
  Voro++ (http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/ and https://github.com/chr1shr/voro) is used for computations of Laguerre tessellation
  Eigen

the capabilities of the library are demonstrated on several examples:

pipp_sim.cpp

pipp_estim.cpp

rad_sim.cpp

rad_estim.cpp

Source_Lag_tess.cpp - shows how to compute a Laguerre tessellation for a given list of generators using Voro++ 




** the code still undergoes extensive changes **
