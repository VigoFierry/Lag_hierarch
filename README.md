Lag_hierarch is a C++ library implementing a hierarchical statistical model for 3D Laguerre tessellation

The model is introduced in paper "Fitting three-dimensional Laguerre tessellations by hierarchical marked point process models"
available at arXiv:

dependencies: Voro++ (http://math.lbl.gov/voro++/ and https://github.com/chr1shr/voro) is used for computations of Laguerre tessellation


** the code still undergoes extensive changes **
